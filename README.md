# ClassRoster
An old college assignment meant to demonstrate some of my ability with C++.

The code can be run by executing the app.exe file in the ClassRoster folder, or the ClassRoster.exe file in the Debug folder. I used Visual Studio Code when working on this project. That application can be used to easily open and look over the code itself.
